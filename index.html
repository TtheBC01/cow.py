    <h1>The Economics of Mining Bitcoin with Cow Manure</h1>
    <p>
        The prospect of mining cryptocurrency with renewable energy is an intriguing idea,
        particularly if the renewable energy is free of monetary cost. Consider mining Bitcoin
        via renewable natural gas (RNG), i.e. methane from cow manure.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the <a href="https://directives.sc.egov.usda.gov/viewerFS.aspx?hid=21430">Agricultural Waste
            Management Field Handbook</a>, a cow can produce between
        <a href="https://directives.sc.egov.usda.gov/OpenNonWebContent.aspx?content=31475.wba"> <strong
                class="pop">85</strong> and <strong class="pop">133</strong> pounds of
            waste per day</a> based on a normalized <em>animal unit</em> of <strong class="pop">1000</strong> lbs (i.e.
        every <strong class="pop">1000</strong> lbs of bovine live
        stock produces between <strong class="pop">85</strong> and <strong class="pop">133</strong> lbs of manure per
        day). Furthermore, research suggests that cow manure
        outgases between <a
            href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324976649_Biogas_Production_from_Different_Types_of_Cow_Manure#:~:text=The%20methane%20yield%20was%20found,%2Fkg%20VS"><strong
                class="pop">160</strong>
            and <strong class="pop">216</strong> L of methane per kg of
            manure</a>.
        This equates to <strong class="pop">4.4</strong> to <strong class="pop">6.9</strong> kg of methane gas
        production per day assuming the density of methane at <a
            href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/methane-d_1420.html">standard
            temperature and pressure is <strong class="pop">0.72</strong> g/L</a>. A kilogram of methane gas contains
        approximately
        <a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/heat-values-of-various-fuels.aspx"><strong
                class="pop">50</strong>MJ
            of
            energy</a>.
        Modern methane-based electric generators
        can operate at a thermodynamic efficiency in the <a
            href="https://www.yanmar.com/global/about/technology/technical_review/2016/0727_1.html#:~:text=The%20BP%2DG%20power%20generation,23.3MJ%2FNm3">range
            of
            <strong class="pop">36%</strong></a>.
        Assuming <strong class="pop">86400</strong> seconds in a day, a cow produces approximately <strong
            class="pop">921</strong> to <strong class="pop">1441</strong> Watts (J/s) of usable
        electric power from RNG.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Bitcoin transaction is estimated to require <a
            href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/08/18/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-use/">approximately <strong
                class="pop">1720</strong>
            kWh</a>
        of energy to confirm. Based on current network activity, there are typically
        <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions-per-block"><strong class="pop">1800</strong>
            transactions per block</a>
        mined in the Bitcoin network. Therefore, a block requires, on average, <strong class="pop">3096</strong> MWh
        of energy to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current block reward in the Bitcoin network is <a
            href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769#:~:text=As%20of%202022%2C%20Bitcoin%20miners,the%20block%20reward%20approaches%20zero."><strong
                class="pop">6.25</strong>
            BTC per block</a>.
        As of <a id="date" onload='getDate'></a>, the price of BTC is around <a
            href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/"><strong class="pop">$20,000</strong> USD</a>.
        So, a new block is worth at least <strong class="pop">$125,000</strong> USD plus transaction fees associated
        with the mined
        transactions which are currently negligible in comparison to the block reward. This is equivalent to
        saying the Bitcoin network pays ~<strong class="pop">$0.00004037</strong> per Watt-hour to secure the network.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a cow produces ~<strong class="pop">80</strong> to <strong class="pop">124</strong> MJ of usable (i.e.
        accounting for generator efficiency) energy
        per day in the form of RNG, and said cow is paid fair market rate from the Bitcoin network for
        its RNG-based electric output, the cow should earn about <strong class="pop">$25</strong> to<strong
            class="pop">$55</strong> per month. If you assume
        a <strong class="pop">20</strong> percent reduction in output due to various parasitic losses in RNG capture and
        conversion
        to electricity as well an additional <strong class="pop">20</strong> percent reduction due to unplanned outages,
        downtime
        due to upgrades, etc., then the cow's conservative earning potential is in the ballpark of <strong
            class="pop">$17</strong>
        to <strong class="pop">$25</strong> per month. See <a
            href="https://github.com/TtheBC01/cow.py/blob/main/cow.py">cow.py</a> for calculations.
