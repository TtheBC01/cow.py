# cow.py 🤔💭🐄💩=💰

This is a simple website that uses [pyscript](https://pyscript.net/) (instead of regular old javascript) to fetch some data and run some simple calculations in the browser. Why? So that the cow.py pun makes sense. 

## To run locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TtheBC01/cow.py.git
cd cow.py
python -m http.server
```
