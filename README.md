# Economics of Mining Bitcoin with Cow Manure

The prospect of mining cryptocurrency with renewable energy is an intriguing  idea, particularly if the renewable energy is free of monetary cost. 
Consider mining Bitcoin via renewable natural gas (RNG), i.e. methane from cow manure. 

The average cow produces approximately [`150-250` pounds of methane per year](https://www.epa.gov/snep/agriculture-and-aquaculture-food-thought#:~:text=A%20single%20cow%20produces%20between,(Our%20World%20in%20Data)). A kilogram of methane gas contains approximately
[`50`MJ of energy](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/heat-values-of-various-fuels.aspx). Modern methane-based electric generators
can operate at a thermodynamic  efficiency in the [range of `36%`](https://www.yanmar.com/global/about/technology/technical_review/2016/0727_1.html#:~:text=The%20BP%2DG%20power%20generation,23.3MJ%2FNm3).). Assuming `30` days in a month, a cow produces approximately `30` to `60` Watts of usable
electric power from RNG. 

A Bitcoin transaction is estimated to require [approximately `1720` kWh](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/08/18/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-use/) of energy to confirm. Based on current network activity, there are typically [`1800` transactions per block](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions-per-block) mined in the Bitcoin network.  Therefore, a block requires, on average, `3096` MWh of energy to mine. 

The current block reward in the Bitcoin network is [`6.25` BTC per block](https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769#:~:text=As%20of%202022%2C%20Bitcoin%20miners,the%20block%20reward%20approaches%20zero.). As of 9/14/2022, the price of BTC is around
[`$20,000` USD](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/). So, a new block is worth at least `$125,000` USD plus transaction fees associated with the 
mined transactions which are currently negligible in comparison to the block reward. This is equivalent to saying the Bitcoin network
pays ~`$0.00004037` per Watt-hour to secure the network. 

If a cow produces ~`80` to `160` MJ of usable (i.e. accounting for generator efficiency) energy per month in the form of RNG, this is the equivalent to `30` to `60` Watts of electricity per cow. Thus, is the cow is paid fair market rate for its RNG-based electric output from the Bitcoin network, said cow should earn about `$1` to
`$2` per month.
